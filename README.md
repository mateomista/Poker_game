Five-Card Draw is a straightforward and strategic poker variant where players aim to build the best hand after a single draw round. It’s a perfect blend of skill, strategy, and a touch of luck.

Basic Rules
- Initial Deal: Each player is dealt five cards.
- Initial Betting Round: Players place bets based on their initial hand.
- Draw Round: Players can discard 0 to 5 cards and receive new ones from the deck.
- Final Betting Round: Players bet again based on their final hand.
- Showdown: Players reveal their hands, and the player with the best hand (following standard poker rankings) wins the pot.
  
The Draw Round
- Players analyze their initial hand and decide how many cards (if any) they wish to discard and replace.
- This round is crucial for strategy: players must weigh the odds of improving their hand against the risks of betting too much or too little.
  
Computer Opponent Behavior

In Tapped Poker, the player competes against a computer-controlled opponent. The computer’s behavior is driven by:
- Decision Algorithms: The computer evaluates the strength of its hand to make logical decisions on betting, drawing, and folding.
- Randomness: To simulate unpredictability, the computer incorporates random elements into its decision-making, mimicking human behavior and keeping the game dynamic and challenging.
